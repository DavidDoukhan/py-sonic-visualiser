Welcome to py_sonicvisualiser's documentation!
==============================================

py_sonicvisualiser is a framework for manipulating environment files
to be used with sonic visualiser, and application for viewing and analysing the contents of music audio files http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/

This module is currently restricted to the generation of sonic visualiser environment files (export). Parsing (import) of such files will be hopefully supported in the next releases.


Latest sources files are available at https://github.com/DavidDoukhan/py_sonicvisualiser .
